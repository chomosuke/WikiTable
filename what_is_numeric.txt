What is a numeric column?
Sometimes numeric column can have strange unit attached with them, it's impossible to predict all possible units or postfix, hence we can only exclude the column that start with numbers but definitely isn't numerical. The most obvious kind of column of that sort is time and date.

Therefore, any column with all of it's cell starting with a number that's can't be interpreted as time or date is a numeric column.
